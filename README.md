## Setup

## Report

I chose to analyze the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) dataset on [Los Angeles Crime](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present). I chose this dataset because it has a large amount of data and is more interesting than just finding abnormal trends something like air quality.

Due to the scope of this project, I decided to define an abnormality as crimes that are occur in an abnormal area, based on the type of crime and the trends for that area. The real world application of this would be to help the police department allocate their resources in an optimal way.
